# Platypus

Platypus is a WordPress plugin update search tool. It runs the standard `wp plugin list --update=available` command as well as some custom searches to grab those hard to find plugin updates.

Below is the current list of plugins requiring updates for test.blog.ca.

```

## Prerequisite

- Googles' [Go language](https://go.dev) installed to enable building executables from source code.

- Creation of a variables file with the following values as per your environment:

```go
const (
server, path, site string = /* [target server], [wordpress path], [wordpress url] */
sender, recipient, user string = /* [mail sender], [mail recipient], [authorized user] */
)

// Allow only a predefined set of servers
var (
servers = []string{/* list of servers to test against */}
)
```

## Build

From the root folder containing *main.go*, use the command that matches your environment:

### Windows & Mac:

```console
go build -o [name] main.go
```

### Linux:

```console
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o [name] main.go
```

## Run

```console
./[program] [flag]
```

Currently the only working flags are **-p**, **-h**, and **-v**

Example:

```console
./platypus -p
```
